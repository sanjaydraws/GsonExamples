Gson (also known as Google Gson) is a small Java-based library  for parsing and creating JSON objects.
 Itâ€™s a serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back.


 Uses of Gson
-> Conversion of Java Objects into JSON and back.
-> Conversion of a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.


(a). Gson
Gson is a class found in com.google.gson package and is the main class we need to use Gson Library.

Normally we use it first by first constructing a Gson instance and then invoking toJson(Object) or fromJson(String, Class) methods on it.

(b). JsonElement
JsonElement is a class found in com.google.gson package that represents an element of Json.

Here are JsonElement Objects:
JsonObject
JsonArray
JsonPrimitive
JsonNull.

(c) JsonObject -> is a class found in com.google.gson package that represents an object type in Json.
This object can comprise name-value pairs where names are strings, and values are any other type of JsonElement.
With this then we can build a tree of JsonElements. Those elements are maintained in order they were added.


d).JsonParser -> JsonParser is a class found in com.google.gson package that is used to parse Json into a parse tree of JsonElements
